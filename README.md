# x16-tile-editor
Tile/Sprite Editor for the Commander X16

## Overview
This application is going to be part of the official [Commander X16 ROM](https://github.com/X16Community/x16-rom) as an always-available development tool for creating and editing sprite and tile graphics. The asset files it creates can be loaded into VRAM using built-in BASIC and Kernal routines. It supports all of the tile/sprite dimensions and color depths allowed by the VERA graphics adapter, and also lets you define and save a custom 256-color palette.
